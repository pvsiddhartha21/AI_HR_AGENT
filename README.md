# AI_HR_AGENT
The AI HR Agent is an n8n-based automation workflow that screens resumes against job requirements to shortlist candidates. It then manages two interview rounds and tracks candidate progress through each stage. After evaluation, the agent automatically sends selection or rejection emails to candidates.
